		<h2>Quick Info</h2>
		<p>I have reworked this quite a bit from my first submission regarding this assignment. I
			have found this class to be rather enjoyable and interesting when it comes to learning HTML as I am new to
			website development. If you have any pointers or think of stuff I can do to improve, please let me know!</p>
		<p>In the "Background Info page, I give a quick history of my skill-sets and some of the
			things I have done, followed by photos I have taken of my work.</p>
		<p>The "Hobbies" page is pretty self explanitory. I have included a small list with some
			images I found on the internet that I thought were cool representations of a few examples. I was also
			playing around with linking a video and was shown, by Mrs. Markley, a way to embed a video to the page which
			I thought was really neat! My daughters and I thought this was a cute video to share.</p>
