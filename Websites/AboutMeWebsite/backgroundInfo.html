				<h2>Work History</h2>
				<p> I have worked trades most of my adult life and have done many different types of
					jobs that I have enjoyed and done well in.
					I started out working at Mercy Hospital in Springfield for my first big boy job in their environmental
					services department where I did janitorial work like buffing and laying wax.
					From there I got into the maintenance department where I learned many different skills like painting,
					drywall, flooring, construction, vinyl installation and even graphic design.
					I have also worked in a welding shop for 3 years as a lead in the Electropolish department, worked as a
					grinder, tried my hand at welding, and manned the waterjet.
					I have returned to work at Mercy where I am currently at while I go to school for my AAS.CIS in Computer
					Information Science where I want to pursue a career in either program development or cyber security. I
					still haven't stuck with what I want to be when I grow up.</p>
